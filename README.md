# Scroll-website
I coded this responsive scroll website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I added hover effect to the Nav_links, Explore and Schedule Call buttons.
I also added hover effect to transform the scale (zoom in and out) of the product cards.
The drop down menu for the mobile view was made responsive using media in CSS and made active in the JavaScript file (app.js)

Pictures of the Mobile & Desktop view of this Responsive Scroll website is here
